Config file version.

There are two version ids.  The "majorid" attribute should be changed
whenever a change to the structure
of this file makes it incompatible with other versions of animgen.
The same value should be set in the variable ConfigMajorVersion
in animgenlib.cpp.  The program checks that the two are identical
and throws a fatal error if they are not.

"minorid" should be changed when this file changes in any way
that will not cause problems for any version of animgen having the
correct majorid.  This value will be read and reported to the log
file by animgen, but is otherwise ignored.

	Major and minor version updated from 2004-08-03 to 2007-03-18.
	Changes:
		<bodyconstraints> attribute reachInit replaced by
			reachFar, reachNearHard, and reachNearSoft, to allow for
			pulling the shoulder back when the wrist joint would
			otherwise be too near the shoulder.
		maxScAngleOut and maxScAngleIn renamed to maxScAngleFwd and

<!--
one_handed_compliance:
When only one hand moves in order to establish a handconstellation
with the other, the other hand will move this proportion of the way
to or from the designated moving hand.

elbow_max_straightness:
The minimum allowed value for the exterior angle at the elbow, in
radians.

elbow_max_raise:
The maximum allowed rotation of the arm about the shoulder-wrist
axis in order to prevent the upper arm intersecting the torso, in
radians.

scAngleProportion:
The sternoclavicular joint is only allowed to move at most this
proportion of the angle from the lateral direction to the target
direction, as measured from the midpoint between the shoulders.

maxScAngle:
The maximum angle of rotation of the sternoclavicular joint.

reachFar:
That proportion of the maximum reach distance beyond which the
sternoclavicular joint will begin to be used to reach positions
far away.

reachNearHard:
The minimum separation that animgen will attempt to maintain
between wrist joint and shoulder joint, as a proportion of maximum
reach distance.

reachNearSoft:
That proportion of reachNearHard within which the
sternoclavicular joint will begin to be used to reach positions
close to the shoulder joint.  Always at least 1.

bodyAngle:
The maximum angle between the upper arm and a certain vector.
These are chosen so as to prevent the upper arm penetrating
the torso.

upperArmProportion:
When calculating the bodyAngle from points defining a cone centered
at the shoulder (instead of using the bodyAngle parameter), the
angle of the cone is increased by a certain proportion of the angle
between the upper arm axis and a line from the shoulder to the
surface of the upper arm.  This parameter is that proportion.
A negative value is allowed.

forearmTwist:
The proportion of the wrist rotation about its Y axis that is
transferred to the elbow.

handAngle:
The maximum bending of the wrist joint about the X axis.
Obsolete.

Information determining the response of the various controllers.
timeConstant is roughly the reciprocal of the characteristic time
	for the controller to respond to a step change in reference.
oscConstant should be zero for critically damped motion, positive
	for underdamped, and negative for overdamped.  A value of around
	0.05 is generally suitable.  Critically or overdamped motion
	looks sluggish.
speedUp determines how much the time constant should increase as the
	error approaches zero.  Values in the range of 5 to 12 generally
	work well.  Higher values can cause instability.
overshoot is obsolete.  It applies only to scalar controllers, and
	has the effect of terminating the response as soon as the error
	goes to (or past) zero.  This was an early attempt to obtain the
	effect of stopping suddenly, and was superceded by the speedUp
	parameter.  However, overshoot is still useful for modelling
	contact stops.

For each of these, 0 represents the value when the joint is not bent
and 4 is its maximum bending,  These minima and maxima are defined in

Each handshape has two different finger bendings:
"specialbends" is the bending of the extended fingers (e.g. the index
